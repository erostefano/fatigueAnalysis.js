# fatigueAnalysis.js

fatigueAnalysis.js is a TensorFlow-powered JavaScript project designed to detect fatigue in real-time through an
integrated webcam. By training and utilizing machine learning models, the system accurately analyzes facial features to
determine tiredness, offering valuable insights for health and safety.

Imagine a long road trip with friends and familyâ€”wouldn't it be nice to check if the driver is okay? With
fatigueAnalysis.js, you can monitor the driver's alertness and ensure everyone stays safe on the road.

## Feature Engineering

### Labels

- **Eyes open:** Represents when the eyes are open and visible.
- **Eyes closed:** Represents when the eyes closed.
- **Yawning:** Represents when the mouth is covered by the hand.

### Data Collection

- **Video Recording:** For each label a 30 seconds video has been recorded in car.
- **Frame Extraction:** Every frame has been extracted. Note: Large dataset may cause git issues.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Face Extraction**: Using the Blazeface model from TensorFlow.js, the face has been extracted from each frame. The
  image size has been reduced to max. 35 kB

## Training

- Load the faces and train the model

## Application

- Use the video stream
- Use mediapipe face detection to detect the face
- Predict the face

## Operation

- Explain why the images of one person are enough (tailored, fast release)
- Write about performance and user behaviour analysis
