# fatigueAnalysis.js

fatigueAnalysis.js is a TensorFlow-powered JavaScript project designed to detect fatigue in real-time through an
integrated webcam. By training and utilizing machine learning models, the system accurately analyzes facial features to
determine tiredness, offering valuable insights for health and safety.

Imagine a long road trip with friends and familyâ€”wouldn't it be nice to check if the driver is okay? With
fatigueAnalysis.js, you can monitor the driver's alertness and ensure everyone stays safe on the road.
